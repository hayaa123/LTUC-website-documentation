- title is required, to fill the content is similar of the content inside about us page at first step.

- for programs block: fill the title of the entire section(for example: Our Programs), then fill for each program: name, image, details and either an external url by 'button url field' or an internal program detail page by 'button page field'. finally, the text of the button. 

### important note:
if the program is from an external website you should add it as 'button url field'.

and if the program is from your site (internally):
- first, keep the 'button url field' and 'button page field' empty. and dont forget to save it.
